# Label-Me
Label Me is a tool that provides two main features: visualization and annotation.  These features revolve around temporal data, such as videos, one dimensional waveforms, and two dimensional motion.  Label Me was built using JavaFX.

## Visualization
Movement in time is always reflected in all data sources, making it easy to find associations between data sources.  Initial timing offsets between files can be easily tweaked to synchronize multiple data sources.

## Annotation
Labeling time segments is performed by entering the start and stop time.
